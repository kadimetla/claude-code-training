6. [Lab 6: Advanced Workflows](#lab-6-advanced-workflows)

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`, or Homebrew / WinGet — see slides)
- An active subscription (Pro / Max / Team / Enterprise) **or** API credits via the Claude Console
- Git repository access
- Development environment for multiple languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java)

### Permission modes (background)

You'll meet a few permission modes during the labs:

- **Default** — Claude prompts before risky actions. Good for learning.
- **Auto-Accept** (`Shift+Tab`) — blanket approval of write actions. Use when you trust the next few steps.
- **Auto Mode** — Sonnet 4.6 classifier decides per action. Modern recommended escape hatch (replaces `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which still works but is now legacy).
- **`/sandbox`** — sandboxed shell for risky commands. **Note:** `/sandbox` requires WSL 2 — not available on native Windows or WSL 1.

When restricting tools in headless or CI workflows, prefer `--disallowedTools` over `--allowedTools` — the allow-list flag may be ignored in `bypassPermissions` mode.

## Lab 0: Project Creation from Scratch

**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Goal**: Create a lyrics display application from scratch (this is how the `lyrics-trainer` project began, which we'll look at later)

### Setup

1. Create a new empty directory: `mkdir lyrics-display && cd lyrics-display`
2. Initialize git: `git init`
3. Start Claude Code: `claude`
4. Create your first branch: `git checkout -b basic-lyrics-app`
5. Choose source text: prefer public-domain content for demos so copyright filters don't degrade Claude's responses. The repo ships `sonnet_18.txt` (Shakespeare) at the root — copy it as your starting point:
   ```bash
   cp ../sonnet_18.txt lyrics.txt
   ```
   You can also use any other public-domain text — Project Gutenberg has thousands of options. Avoid copyrighted song lyrics; they tend to trip content filters and make demos unreliable.

### Exercises

1. **Project foundation**:
   ```
   I have song lyrics saved in lyrics.txt. Create a web application that displays these lyrics one line at a time with three buttons: Next, Previous, and Play. The Play button should automatically advance through lines with a 2-second delay.
   ```

2. **Enhanced functionality**:
   ```
   Add line numbering, show progress (e.g., 'Line 5 of 32'), and make the Play button toggle to Pause when active. Style it to look modern and clean.
   ```

3. **Visual improvements**:
   ```
   Add smooth transitions between lines, better typography, and responsive design. Make it visually appealing with a music-themed color scheme.
   ```

4. **Advanced features**:
   ```
   Add keyboard shortcuts: spacebar for play/pause, arrow keys for next/previous. Also add a progress bar showing position in the song.
   ```

5. **Documentation and structure**:
   ```
   Create a README.md explaining the project, and organize the code into separate CSS and JavaScript files for better maintainability.
   ```

6. **Version control and experimentation**:
   ```
   Help me commit this work, then create a new branch called 'speed-control' and add a slider to control the playback speed.
   ```

### Expected Outcomes

- Build a real, useful application from nothing
- See how Claude Code handles file interactions and user interface logic
- Experience the full development cycle: concept → working app → enhancements
- Understand that this is exactly how the `lyrics-trainer` project started
- Practice iterative development with AI assistance

**Note**: This exercise recreates the origin story of the `lyrics-trainer` project in the exercises folder - you're experiencing the same process that created one of our example applications!

## Lab 5: Legacy Code Refactoring

**Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Goal**: Modernize legacy code using Claude Code assistance, with a first taste of skills

### Setup

Use the `exercises/java/shopping-service` (Grails/Groovy) project or any legacy code you have available. Optionally install two skills from this repo so the modernization and security work are one slash command away:

```bash
# From the project root
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/modernize-java skills/security-review ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Exercises

1. **Code modernization** (try the skill, then a freeform prompt):
   ```
   /modernize-java
   ```
   Then, on a different file:
   ```
   Refactor this class to use modern Java features like records, switch expressions, and Optional
   ```

2. **Spring Boot updates**:
   ```
   Update this Spring configuration to use modern Spring Boot patterns and annotations
   ```

3. **Exception handling improvement**:
   ```

   ```

4. **Performance optimization**:
   ```
   Review this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
   ```

5. **Security review** (try the skill — note it's read-only by `allowed-tools`):
   ```
   /security-review
   ```
   Compare with a freeform request:
   ```
   Review this controller for security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes
   ```

### Expected Outcomes

- Learn systematic refactoring approaches
- Understand modern development patterns
- Practice security-focused code review
- Experience how a skill's frontmatter (e.g., `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob`) shapes its behavior

## Lab 6: Advanced Workflows

**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Goal**: Master advanced Claude Code features including Plan Mode, Skills, Plugins, Output Styles, Hooks, MCP, Agent Teams, and Surfaces

### Setup

Navigate to the `exercises/python/weather-app` directory for this lab.

### Exercises

#### Part A: Plan Mode and Subagents (5 minutes)

1. **Plan Mode usage**:
   - Type `/plan` to activate Plan Mode (or cycle with `Shift+Tab`)
   ```
   Plan a comprehensive improvement to add error handling and logging to this Flask application
   ```
   - Review the plan before execution
   - Observe that Plan Mode uses the Plan subagent
   - Execute step by step or approve the entire plan

2. **Understanding Subagents and Effort Levels**:
   ```
   Explain which subagents you use and when they activate automatically
   ```
   - Learn about Explore, Plan, and General-purpose subagents
   - Understand how Claude selects the right agent for each task
   - **Effort levels**: `/effort low|medium|high` controls reasoning depth
   - **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Alt+P` switches models mid-conversation

#### Part B: Skills and Plugins (15 minutes)

> **Note**: As of Claude Code 2.1, **custom slash commands have been merged into skills**. `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is the recommended form; `.claude/commands/<name>.md` still works but is the legacy form. If a command and a skill share a name, the skill wins. Skills support frontmatter for `paths`, `allowed-tools`, `context: fork`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `model`, and `effort`. Hot-reload — edits take effect immediately. Precedence: `Enterprise > Personal > Project`; plugin skills are namespaced separately.

3. **Explore Built-in Skills**:
   ```
   Create a quarterly weather report as an Excel spreadsheet with charts showing temperature trends
   ```
   - The xlsx skill will activate automatically
   - Observe how skills load progressively

4. **Install and Test a Custom Skill**:
   ```bash
   # Copy example skill to your local skills directory
   # (Run from the claude-code-training project root)
   cp -r skills-and-plugins/api-documentation-skill ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

   Then ask:
   ```
   Generate comprehensive API documentation for the weather app's REST endpoints
   ```
   - The API Documentation skill should activate
   - Review the generated documentation format

5. **Create Your Own Skill**:
   ```
   Help me create a custom skill for Python Flask best practices that includes:
   - Constructor injection patterns
   - Error handling conventions
   - Logging standards
   - Testing requirements
   Save it to ~/.claude/skills/flask-best-practices/
   ```

6. **Explore Plugins** (Discussion):
   - Review `skills-and-plugins/plugin-examples/team-standards-plugin.md` (from project root)
   - Discuss how plugins bundle commands, skills, hooks, and MCP servers
   - Understand use cases for team-wide plugin distribution

#### Part C: Output Styles (5 minutes)

7. **Test Built-in Output Styles**:
   ```bash
   # Exit current session, start with explanatory style
   claude --output-style explanatory
   ```

   Ask the same question twice with different styles:
   ```
   Explain how the weather API integration works
   ```

   Exit and try learning style:
   ```bash
   claude --output-style learning
   ```
   ```
   Explain how the weather API integration works
   ```
   - Compare the verbosity and teaching approach

8. **Create Custom Output Style**:
   ```
   Help me create a custom output style called 'production' that:
   - Is concise and action-focused
   - Skips explanations unless asked
   - Assumes expert-level knowledge
   - Shows code without preambles
   Save it to ~/.claude/output-styles/production.md
   ```

#### Part D: Hooks and Automation (10 minutes)

9. **Configure a SessionEnd Hook**:
   ```bash
   # Copy example hook (run from project root)
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
   cp hooks-examples/session-end-summary.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
   chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/session-end-summary.sh
   ```

   Then configure it:
   ```
   Add a SessionEnd hook to my ~/.claude/settings.json that runs ~/.claude/hooks/session-end-summary.sh using the current hook array format
   ```

10. **Test PreToolUse Hook** - Security Validator:
   ```bash
   # Copy security hook (run from project root)
   cp hooks-examples/security-validator.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
   chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/security-validator.sh
   ```

   Configure it:
   ```
   Add a PreToolUse hook for Write operations that runs ~/.claude/hooks/security-validator.sh to check for hardcoded secrets. Use the current hook array format with an "if" matcher.
   ```

   Test it:
   ```
   Create a config file with: API_KEY = 'sk_live_1234567890abcdef'
   ```
   - The hook should block this and explain why
   - Try again with environment variable approach

11. **Create Your Own Hook**:
   ```
   Create a hook that runs prettier to auto-format Python files before any Edit operation. Save it to ~/.claude/hooks/format-python.sh
   ```

#### Part E: MCP Server Integration (5 minutes)

> **Note**: MCP Tool Search (lazy loading) is now enabled by default. Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront, Claude discovers tools on demand — reducing context usage by ~95% with many MCP tools.

12. **List and Explore MCP Servers**:
   ```bash
   # List currently configured MCP servers
   claude mcp list
   ```

   Then in Claude Code:
   ```
   What MCP servers are available and what tools do they provide?
   ```

13. **Add Context7 MCP Server** (for up-to-date documentation):
   ```bash
   # Add Context7 for fetching latest library docs
   claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
   ```

   Test it:
   ```
   Using Context7, look up the latest Flask documentation for error handling
   ```

14. **Import from Claude Desktop** (if you have Claude Desktop installed):
   ```bash
   # Import any MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop
   claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
   ```

15. **Explore MCP Tools**:
   ```
   Show me what tools are available from the MCP servers and demonstrate one
   ```
   - Observe how MCP extends Claude's capabilities
   - Note the `mcp__` prefix on tool names

#### Part F: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and Skills vs Commands (5 minutes)

16. **CLAUDE.md creation**:
   ```
   Create a CLAUDE.md file for this weather app with Python coding standards, dependencies, and project context
   ```

   Note that the built-in slash command `/init` creates the `CLAUDE.md` file, but you can simply ask Claude to create it.

17. **The AGENTS.md trap (and the bridge pattern)**:
   ```
   This repo also has an AGENTS.md (Codex's convention). Claude Code does not natively read it. Update CLAUDE.md to reference @AGENTS.md so the cross-tool conventions are picked up. Explain what changed and why.
   ```

   Observe how `@filepath` import keeps a single source of truth.

18. **Skill vs. legacy command** (compare side-by-side):
   ```
   Help me create a skill called 'update-deps' under .claude/skills/update-deps/SKILL.md for updating Python dependencies safely. Use frontmatter to scope tools (Bash, Read, Edit) and trigger on requirements.txt and pyproject.toml. Then create the same workflow as a legacy .claude/commands/update-deps.md file and explain which capabilities the skill has that the command doesn't.
   ```

   This contrast — same automation, two forms — is the heart of the merge.

#### Part G: Feature Enhancement with All Tools (5 minutes)

18. **Comprehensive Enhancement**:

   Now use Plan Mode with all your new tools:
   ```
   Using Plan Mode, add comprehensive error handling and structured logging to this application. The security hook should verify no secrets are added, and generate API documentation using the skill when done.
   ```

   - Observe how multiple advanced features work together
   - Note subagent selection, skill activation, and hook execution

#### Part H: Agent Teams (10 minutes)

> **Note**: Agent Teams is a research preview feature. Enable it with:
> ```bash
> export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
> ```

19. **Launch an Agent Team**:

   Navigate to the `exercises/java/certificate-service` directory:
   ```
   Create a team of agents to improve this project. One agent should review
   the test suite and identify coverage gaps, another should review the code
   for security issues, and a third should update the documentation.
   Coordinate the work and give me a summary when done.
   ```

   Observe:
   - The lead agent creates a task list and assigns teammates
   - Each teammate works independently in its own context
   - Teammates report back as they complete tasks
   - The lead agent synthesizes results

20. **Monitor Team Progress**:

   While the team works, observe:
   - Task status updates in the output
   - Inter-agent messages (DMs between teammates)
   - How idle teammates wake up when assigned new work
   - The shared task list with dependencies

21. **Simpler Team Exercise** (alternative if time is short):
   ```
   Create a team with two agents: one to add input validation to the
   certificate controller, and another to write tests for that validation.
   The test agent should wait until the validation agent finishes.
   ```

   This demonstrates task dependencies (`blocks`/`blockedBy`).

22. **Background Agents and Worktree Isolation**:
   ```bash
   # Start Claude in an isolated worktree
   claude -w
   ```
   ```
   Refactor the PdfService to use the builder pattern, then run all tests
   ```
   - Notice you're on a separate branch in an isolated directory
   - Changes don't affect your main working tree
   - On exit, you'll be asked to keep or remove the worktree

#### Part I: Surfaces & Remote Workflows (10 minutes, optional)

23. **Explore `/powerup`** (Self-learning):
   ```
   /powerup
   ```
   - Browse interactive lessons on Claude Code features
   - Try a lesson on a feature you haven't used before

24. **Try Remote Session** (if claude.ai/code access available):
   ```bash
   # Start a cloud session from your terminal
   claude --remote "Analyze the weather-app for potential performance improvements"
   ```
   - Observe the session running on Anthropic cloud
   - Visit claude.ai/code to see the session in browser
   - Try `/teleport` to pull it back to your terminal

25. **Discussion: Surfaces & Dispatch**:
   - Review the 5 surfaces: CLI, VS Code, JetBrains, Desktop app, Web
   - Discuss Dispatch: sending tasks from phone to desktop
   - When would you use each surface?
   - How do scheduled tasks differ across surfaces?

### Expected Outcomes

After completing this lab, you will:
- Master Plan Mode and understand subagent architecture
- Know when and how to use Skills for domain expertise
- Understand plugin system for team collaboration
- Customize output styles for different contexts
- Implement hooks for workflow automation
- Configure and use MCP servers for extended capabilities
- Create reusable project configurations with CLAUDE.md
- Build skills (with optional `.claude/commands/` legacy form for contrast) for common workflows
- Orchestrate multiple advanced features together
- **Launch and coordinate Agent Teams for parallel work**
- **Use worktree isolation for safe experimentation**
- **Run background agents for concurrent workflows**
- **Understand the 5 Claude Code surfaces and when to use each**
- **Use `/powerup` for self-directed feature learning**

### Troubleshooting

**Skills not activating?**
- Check that SKILL.md has proper YAML frontmatter
- Verify skill directory is in `~/.claude/skills/`
- Ask Claude if the skill loaded: `/skills list` (if available)

**Hooks not running?**
- Verify hook script has execute permissions: `chmod +x hook.sh`
- Check settings.json syntax is valid JSON
- Review hook output - errors appear as user messages

**Output style not changing?**
- Verify file is in `~/.claude/output-styles/`
- Check YAML frontmatter format
- Restart claude with `--output-style` flag

**MCP servers not working?**
- Run `claude mcp list` to verify server is configured
- Check that remote servers are accessible (network/firewall)
- For local servers, verify the command exists and is executable
- Restart Claude Code after adding new MCP servers
- Note: MCP Tool Search (lazy loading) means tools aren't visible until used

**Agent Teams not starting?**
- Verify the environment variable: `echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`
- Must be set to `1` before starting Claude Code
- Teams require sufficient plan credits (each teammate uses tokens independently)
- If teammates seem stuck, the lead agent will typically retry or reassign

**Worktree issues?**
- Must be in a git repository to use `claude -w`
- Worktree is created under `.claude/worktrees/` in the repo
- If a worktree wasn't cleaned up, use `git worktree list` and `git worktree remove`
